**Text_Classification using Tensorflow 2.0 (Keras)**


This is a quick introduction to use tensorflow for image classification problem. Here are the steps to follow

1. Load train and test data

2. Clean and Preprocess the text data 

3. Tokenize the text to feed to the model

4. Add padding text sequence 

5. Split train and test data 

6. Train the model using training data with adam optimizer and binary cross_entropy loss

7. Get the model prediction on new test data
